## 🛠 What I’m Working On

I'm building tools at the intersection of AI and automation to make real-world workflows smarter and faster. My current focus is on prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, and automating GenAI QA processes.

- 🧪 **[LLM Prompt Evaluator](https://github.com/Matt-Collman/llm-prompt-evaluator)**  
  A Python-based CLI tool that tests LLM responses against expected outputs, tracks similarity, latency, and OpenAI API cost, and integrates with LangSmith for prompt regression tracking.

- ⚙️ **Automation scripting** using Python + OpenAI SDK
- 📊 Exploring **LLMOps** and scalable GenAI workflows
- 📁 FOIA project: Self-hosted document archive with full-text search

---

## 💡 Goals

- Land a **GenAI QA / Automation Engineer** role
- Build a strong portfolio of useful AI tools
- Keep learning by doing (and shipping!)

## 🧰 Skills & Tools

- Python (3.11+), LangChain, LangSmith, OpenAI SDK
- Prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Git, VS Code, pytest, `.env` config, JSON workflows
